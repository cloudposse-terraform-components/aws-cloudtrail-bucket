# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This component is responsible for provisioning a bucket for storing
  CloudTrail logs for auditing purposes. It's expected to be used alongside
  [the `cloudtrail` component](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/main/modules/cloudtrail).
usage: |-
  **Stack Level**: Regional

  Here's an example snippet for how to use this component. It's suggested to apply this component to only the centralized
  `audit` account.

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      cloudtrail-bucket:
        vars:
          enabled: true
          name: "cloudtrail"
          noncurrent_version_expiration_days: 180
          noncurrent_version_transition_days: 30
          standard_transition_days: 60
          glacier_transition_days: 180
          expiration_days: 365
  ```
